# FACEBOOK (link prediction challenge-Graph )

In the link prediction problem we are given a snapshot of a network and would like to infer which interactions among existing members are likely to occur in the near future or which existing interactions are we missing.We develop an algorithm based on Supervised Random Walks that naturally combines the information from the network structure with node and edge level attributes. This can be achieved using these attributes to guide a random walk on the graph.
